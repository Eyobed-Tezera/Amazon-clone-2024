Note:- Repetition happens because for each item in the products array, you return a ProductCard component. If the array has 20 elements, map() runs 20 times, hence 20 ProductCard components are created.

- In React, children is a special prop that is automatically provided by React. It contains any nested elements or components passed between the opening and closing tags of the LayOut component.
###    Why we are using ...state

  The ...state part is included because your state might have more than just basket. The state could have other properties (e.g., user info, preferences, etc.), and you don't want to lose or overwrite those when you're updating just the basket. Using ...state ensures that all the other parts of the state are copied over to the new state, untouched.

Let's look at an example:
Suppose your state looks like this:

javascript
Copy code
const state = {
  basket: ['item1', 'item2'],
  user: 'JohnDoe',
  loggedIn: true,
};
If you only returned this:

javascript
Copy code
return {
  basket: [...state.basket, action.item],
};
The new state would only have the basket, and all other properties (user, loggedIn) would be lost:
###########################################reducer method #################################################################
.reducer()= reduce the elements of an array to a single value
    #########################################Example in spread opreator###############################################

// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// console.log(numbers);
// console.log(...numbers);
const numbers = {
  item: {
    image: "image_url",
    title: "Product Title",
    id: 123,
    rating: 4.5,
    price: 29.99,
    description: "Product description",
  },
};
console.log({ ...numbers.item, amount: 1 });
Notice:-------:
while useing we are adding a new item to the object we need to use the spread opreator and specially if it is inside the object.
    #########################################what i used for Autentication###############################################
- Firebase give an Autentication service.
what we are gonna use from firebase:-
 - Autentication
   - we use Firebase to work the Autentication part for us
   - we use firebase database for storing the data orderd by the user(Firestore Database)
   - we deploy our backend on the Functions service that they provided us
Note:- first we need to configer the firebase to our app which has it's own code for doing that for ios,Android and web app.
 in our case it is web-app
